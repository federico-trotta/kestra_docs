## What is an Ochestrator?
In software engineering and data management, an orchestrator is a tool or platform that automates, manages, and coordinates various workflows and tasks across different services, systems, or applications.

Basically, itâ€™s like the conductor of an orchestra, ensuring that all components perform in harmony, following a pre-defined sequence or set of rules. So, whether you're dealing with data pipelines, microservices, or CI/CD systems, orchestrators ensure everything runs smoothly, efficiently, and without human intervention.

## Orchestration VS Automation
It's  important to distinguish between orchestration and automation, because they're related, but may be confused:
- **Automation**: It refers to the execution of individual tasks or actions without manual intervention. For example, automatically triggering a test suite after a code commit is automation.
- **Orchestration**: On the other hand, orchestration goes beyond automation by managing the flow of multiple interconnected tasks or processes. It defines not only what happens but also when and how things happen, ensuring that all the tasks (that may be automated or not) are executed in the correct order, with the right dependencies and error handling in place.

In essence, while automation focuses on individual tasks, orchestration ensures all the tasks are arranged and managed within a broader, cohesive system. This makes orchestration particularly vital in environments where complex processes with interdependent steps need to be handled efficiently.

To explain even better how automation differ from orchestration, lets make some practical examples.

### Examples of task automation
Here are some examples of task automation:

- **Automated testing after code commit**: When a developer pushes new code to a repository, an automated test suite runs without manual intervention. This automation ensures that the code is tested for errors, performance, or adherence to standards every time a change is made.

- **Automated backups**: A scheduled task automatically triggers data backups at a specific time, say every night at midnight, for example. The system takes a snapshot of databases and stores it in a safe location without requiring manual action from an admin.

- **Automated email notifications**: In customer support systems, an automated task might send an email notification to users once their support ticket status is updated. The system detects the change and triggers the email without human intervention.

### Examples of Orchestration
On the other hand, let's see some examples of orchestration:

- **Data pipeline orchestration**: Consider an ETL workflow where data is extracted from a source, transformed, and then loaded into a database. The orchestrator ensures that these steps happen in sequence: first extracting the data, then transforming it (cleaning or aggregating), and finally loading it into the database. If one step fails, the orchestrator can retry or trigger an error-handling process.

- **CI/CD pipeline orchestration**: In a CI/CD pipeline, orchestration might involve compiling the code, running tests, deploying to a staging environment, and then triggering manual approval for production deployment. The orchestrator ensures that each task runs in the correct order and only when the previous task is succesfully completed.

- **Cloud infrastructure orchestration**: When deploying a new environment in the cloud, an orchestrator could manage the provisioning of servers, databases, and network configurations. It ensures that all resources are created in the right order, with dependencies (like ensuring the network is set up before deploying a database), handling both automated tasks and potentially manual configuration steps.


## Benefits of Using an Orchestrator
Today, IT teams manage a wide range of systems and applications across datacenters, clouds, and edge locations. As these environments become more complex, automating tasks improves efficiency and make processes easier to manage. However, scaling automation may become a need - especially as a company grows - and this is when you may need an orchestrator. 

So, here are some benefits of using an orchestrator:

1. **Efficiency and automation**: When you have multiple processes that need to work in coordination, orchestrators manage these workflows as a whole, reducing the need for manual intervention. This leads to faster execution, less human error, and improved consistency across tasks.

2. **Scalability**: Orchestrators can manage workflows across multiple systems and at scale. Whether you're orchestrating thousands of microservices or handling large-scale data processing tasks, an orchestrator ensures smooth and efficient operation, often with built-in scaling features to accommodate growing workloads.

3. **Error handling and resiliency**: Orchestrators come with built-in features for managing failures, retries, and dependencies. If a task fails, an orchestrator can automatically retry it, alert you, or trigger a predefined recovery mechanism. This resiliency is essential in complex systems where failures are inevitable.

4. **Improved monitoring and control**: Most orchestrators provide real-time monitoring and logs, giving engineers insights into the state of each task, its performance, and potential bottlenecks. This level of control helps in troubleshooting and optimizing workflows.

5. **Processes standardization**: Orchestrators allows companies to standardize processes for the full range of computing systems and services. This improves consistency, and makes it easier to introduce new processes and get them up and running quickly.

## Orchestrators' Common Use Cases
As we've presented what an orchestrator is and what are the benefits of using one, let's preent scenarions where orchestrators are commonly used:

- **Data engineering and ETL pipelines**: In data-driven environments, orchestrators automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data from various sources to their destinations. For example, a data orchestrator can trigger a pipeline to extract data from a database, transform it, and then load it into a data warehouse like Snowflake or Google BigQuery.

- **CI/CD pipelines**: Orchestrators help automate the continuous integration and deployment process by managing tasks such as code building, testing, and deployment. When the engineers define the pipeline steps in configuration files, the orchestrator executes them automatically whenever new code is pushed.

- **Microservices orchestration**: In distributed systems, microservices need to communicate and coordinate with each other. In these environments, orchestrators  manage the lifecycle of these services, ensuring they start, stop, and scale according to predefined rules, ensuring reliability and efficiency in service-to-service interactions.

- **Cloud infrastructure management**: Orchestrators can also automate the process of provisioning cloud infrastructure by orchestrating the creation of cloud resources such as virtual machines, databases, and networking configurations, often in conjunction with continuous delivery pipelines.

## Kestra: an Example of an Orchestrator in Action
Let's show a practical example of an orchestrator in action by using Kestra: an event-driven orchestration platform that govern business-critical workflows as code in the UI.

### -->In particular, thanks to its [real-time triggers](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.md), Kestra [has set a new standard](./2024-06-25-kestra-become-real-time.md) for orchestration, providing companies orchestration in real-time.####

To reproduce this example, make sure you have Kestra installed. Read the [Installation guide](../docs/02.installation/index.md) to do so.

Let's image yoo write a Python script that fetches currency exchange rates from a web API and prints them, if the request is successful. The code could be something like that:
```python
import requests

# Define the URL of the API
api_url = 'https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD'

# Send a GET request to the API
response = requests.get(api_url)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print('Exchange rates data:')
    print(data)
else:
    print('Failed to retrieve data. Status code:', response.status_code)
```

Now, in Kestra, click on **Namespaces** > **Company**:
[company.png]

In **Editor** click on **Create folder** and call it *team*, for example:
[new_folder.png]

Then, click on **Create file** and give it a name and an extension. Let's say you call it `python_test.py`; inside it put the Python code to fetch the data:
[python_test.png]

Now, in **Flows** click on **Create** and fill in the YAML file as follows:
```yaml
id: python_test
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: hello
    type: io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands
    namespaceFiles:
      enabled: true
    taskRunner:
      type: io.kestra.plugin.core.runner.Process
    beforeCommands:
      - pip install requests
    commands:
      - python python_test.py
```

> **NOTE**: The YAML reports the following:
> - The `company.team` namespace which is the subfolder where the Python file is stored.
> - The type `io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.Commands` is used to run Python files that are stored into Kestra. Read more [here](https://kestra.io/plugins/plugin-script-python/tasks/io.kestra.plugin.scripts.python.commands).
> In `beforeCommands` the YAML installs the library `requests`. In this case, Kestra may output a warning where suggest using a virtual environment, but the code runs anyway.
> - `python python_test.py` executes the Python script.

When you've done, click on **Execute** and, in the logs section, you'll see the results:
[results.png]

Finally, if yuou want to improve the workflow even more, you could add a trigger that, for example, downloads the data every hour. Learn more about how to use triggers [here](../docs/03.tutorial/04.triggers.md).


## Conclusions
In conclusion, an orchestrator is an essential tool for automating, managing, and scaling workflows across various domains, from data engineering to microservices and cloud infrastructure. By providing automation, scalability, and error handling, orchestrators enable engineers to focus on building and optimizing their systems rather than managing them manually. Whether you're working on ETL pipelines, CI/CD systems, or distributed services, orchestrators help bring order and efficiency to complex processes.
