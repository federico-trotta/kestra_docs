When it comes to automating and managing complex workflows, choosing the right workflow orchestration makes a massive difference in productivity, scalability, and overall system performance. But with so many orchestration tools available, how do you decide which is the best fit for your needs?

In this article, we'll walk through what makes a workflow orchestration tool, how to pick one, and we'll compare the top 3 choices you can make to help you get the best for you.

Let's dive in!

## What is a Workflow Orchestration Tool?
A workflow [orchestration tool](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md) is software that automates the execution, monitoring, and management of tasks in a defined order across multiple systems or applications. It simplifies and schedules the complex processes behind the scenes, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level business logic rather than managing the infrastructure.

These tools are particularly useful when dealing with data pipelines, automating business processes, and running batch operations as they ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability, particularly when dealing with hundreds or thousands of tasks across distributed environments.

## How to Choose a Workflow Orchestration Tool? 
When choosing the best workflow orchestration tool, it’s important to think beyond just the immediate needs of your project. The tool, in fact, should not only work today but also scale with your future workflows. So, here’s a look at the key factors to consider:

- **Ease of use**: How easy is it to get started with the tool? This doesn’t just mean a smooth installation: it extends to the entire user experience. A good workflow orchestration tool, in fact, should have an intuitive interface, so that managing and monitoring workflows doesn’t feel like rocket science. 
- **Flexibility**: Your workflow orchestration tool needs to adapt to different environments and data sources. Some tools might be great if you're working entirely in the cloud, but what if your workflows span cloud and on-premises infrastructure? Or, what if you’re dealing with a variety of databases, APIs, and batch-processing systems? The right tool should support a broad range of integrations and have the flexibility to handle different types of workloads—from real-time data pipelines to periodic batch jobs. Flexibility also means how easy it is to adjust workflows as requirements change. Can you add new tasks or integrate a new data source without overhauling your entire workflow?
- **Scalability**: Workflows start small but can grow complex fast. You need a tool that can scale not just with more tasks, but with higher volumes of data and a growing number of dependencies. Does the tool support distributed execution so it can handle multiple tasks in parallel across nodes? Does it continue performing well as the number of workflows increases, or does it slow down? Tools with native cloud support (or that are cloud-native) often scale better because they’re designed to handle large-scale, distributed workloads.
- **Extensibility**: At some point, you’ll need a feature that isn’t supported out of the box. Extensibility refers to how easily you can extend or customize the orchestration tool to meet your specific needs. This could be writing custom plugins, integrating with proprietary systems, or creating custom monitoring solutions. A highly extensible tool offers hooks or APIs that allow you to build on top of it. For example, Apache Airflow allows you to define custom operators to fit your unique workflows, while Kestra lets you create custom tasks for any step of the process. Make sure the tool you choose can grow alongside your requirements without forcing you to look for workarounds.
- **Community & Support**: Even the most powerful tools can feel like a dead end without a strong community or good support. An active user community means you’ll find plenty of resources—whether it’s documentation, tutorials, open-source plugins, or quick answers to your questions on forums like GitHub or Stack Overflow. Large communities are also a good sign that the tool is actively maintained and will continue evolving. If your company is likely to need more personalized support, check if the tool offers a managed or enterprise version with dedicated support channels. This can be critical when you’re dealing with production issues and need timely resolutions.

So, with that in mind, let's compare the three best workflow orchestration tools.

## Top Three Workflow Orchestration Tools
So, let’s dive into three of the top workflow orchestration tools: Kestra, Apache Airflow, and Prefect. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but one stands out for its flexibility, ease of use, and innovation.
