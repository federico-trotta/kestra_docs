When it comes to automating and managing complex workflows, choosing the right workflow orchestration makes a massive difference in productivity, scalability, and overall system performance. But with so many orchestration tools available, how do you decide which is the best fit for your needs?

In this article, we'll walk through what makes a workflow orchestration tool, how to pick one, and which ones are the top 3 choices today.

Let's dive in!

## What is a Workflow Orchestration Tool?
A workflow [orchestration tool](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md) is software that automates the execution, monitoring, and management of tasks in a defined order across multiple systems or applications. It simplifies and schedules the complex processes behind the scenes, allowing engineers to focus on higher-level business logic rather than managing the infrastructure.

These tools are particularly useful when dealing with data pipelines, automating business processes, and running batch operations as they ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability, particularly when dealing with hundreds or thousands of tasks across distributed environments.

## How to Choose a Workflow Orchestration Tool? 
When choosing the best workflow orchestration tool for your needs, you have to consider several factors, such as:

- **Ease of use**: How simple is it to set up and manage workflows? Is there a user-friendly UI that helps you?
- **Flexibility**: Does it support the range of environments and data sources you need?
- **Scalability**: Can it handle workflows at the scale you're aiming for?
- **Extensibility**: Does it integrate well with your existing systems and allow for custom extensions?
- **Community & Support**: How active is the user community, and is there good support and documentation available?

So, with that in mind, let's compare the three best workflow orchestration tools.

## Top Three Workflow Orchestration Tools
So, let’s dive into three of the top workflow orchestration tools: Kestra, Apache Airflow, and Prefect. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but one stands out for its flexibility, ease of use, and innovation.

Are you curious to know which one? Well, read along!

### Kestra
![Kestra UI](/blogs/2024-10-DD-workflow-tools-comparison/kestra-UI.png)

[Kestra](https://kestra.io/) is a modern, distributed orchestration tool built for handling complex workflows at scale. It offers flexibility and modularity, making it adaptable to various workflows, from basic task automation to managing massive data pipelines. With a focus on scalability and high availability, Kestra is optimized for modern cloud environments.

**What Kestra Does Better**
Kestra's flexibility with multiple database backends (including Kafka and Elasticsearch) sets it apart from competitors like Airflow, which often struggle with scaling up under heavy loads. Its highly available scheduler ensures that no task is ever left behind, even during infrastructure outages. Unlike some of the older orchestration tools, Kestra is built with modern architectures in mind, making it easier to set up, maintain, and scale across distributed environments.

**Pros**:
- **Highly available scheduler**: Ensures zero downtime and fault tolerance.
- **Flexible database backends**: Support for PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Elasticsearch allows for versatile integrations.
- **Modern design**: Built with modern cloud-native architectures in mind.
- **Intuitive UI**: Easy to set up and monitor workflows without extensive technical knowledge.

**Cons**:
- **Smaller community**: Being newer, Kestra may have a smaller user base with respect to other tools. Though, is rapidly growing.

## Apache Airflow
![Airflow UI](/blogs/2024-10-DD-workflow-tools-comparison/airflow-UI.png)

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is one of the most well-known and widely used workflow orchestration tools. Built by Airbnb and now part of the Apache Software Foundation, Airflow excels at scheduling, managing, and monitoring workflows in Python.

With its directed acyclic graph (DAG) model, Airflow is highly flexible and customizable, supporting a wide array of use cases in data engineering and ETL pipelines.

**What Airflow Does Better**
Airflow’s greatest strength lies in its extensibility and community support. With thousands of integrations and an active open-source community, it's an excellent tool if you're working with complex ETL pipelines or custom Python scripts. Airflow’s DAG model also offers great flexibility for defining task dependencies.

**Pros**:
- **Huge community and ecosystem**: Countless plugins and resources are available for nearly any workflow.
- **Customizability**: Full Python flexibility to define workflows.

**Cons**:
- **Scaling issues**: Airflow’s reliance on a single database can lead to bottlenecks under heavy loads.
- **Complex setup**: Initial configuration can be time-consuming, especially in a distributed environment.
- **Older architecture**: Not designed with cloud-native infrastructure in mind, which can lead to scaling challenges.

### Prefect

![Prefect UI](/blogs/2024-10-DD-workflow-tools-comparison/prefect-UI.png)

[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) is another strong contender in the workflow orchestration space, with a unique focus on making orchestration "invisible." It simplifies the process of writing and managing workflows by providing users with imperative workflows rather than the typical DAG-based approach. Prefect’s core philosophy revolves around making orchestration easy for engineers while staying flexible for various use cases.

**What Prefect Does Better**
Prefect’s focus on developer experience is where it shines. By abstracting much of the complexity of traditional workflow tools, it allows developers to write workflows without worrying about the underlying orchestration infrastructure. Its hybrid execution model also allows tasks to run on any infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on-premises, giving it a degree of flexibility that’s hard to match.

**Pros**:
- **Flexible execution model**: Run workflows anywhere—locally, in the cloud, or hybrid.
- **Simplified infrastructure**: Easier to manage than Airflow’s often complicated setup.

**Cons**:
- **Limited compared to DAGs**: While simpler, imperative workflows lack some of the robustness of DAGs.
- **Newer tool**: Fewer integrations and smaller community compared to Airflow.
