In a recent [blog](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we've defined what an orchestrator is, what are the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when to choose an orchestrator?

In this article, we'll compare Kestra to popular automation tools to help you get a practical understanding of when to choose an orchestrator.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Comparing Kestra to Automation Tools
As we've already clarified the difference between orchestration and automation, let’s dive into how Kestra stacks up against popular automation tools. 

### Kestra Vs. GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the go-to for many developers because it’s embedded right into GitHub, making it super convenient for CI/CD as it allows to build, test, and deploy code right from GitHub: basically, anything developers needs to do in their day-to-day work.

Also, GitHub actions it’s developer-friendly, easy to set up, and integrates well with your codebase. But where it excels in simplicity, it lacks in handling workflows that need to span across multiple systems and here's where Kestra comes into handy.

In fact, if your workflow goes beyond just automating builds and deployments  —let’s say you need to automate data processing tasks across cloud services — Kestra’s orchestration capabilities really shine. Kestra, in fact, can handle more complex workflows with dependencies between services, and it also provides mechanisms for retries and error handling. 

So, if your use case involves coordinating tasks beyond GitHub, Kestra becomes a better choice than GitHub actions.
