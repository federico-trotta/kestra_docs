In a recent [blog](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we've defined what an orchestrator is, what are the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when to choose an orchestrator?

In this article, we'll compare Kestra to popular CI/CD solutions to help you get a practical understanding of when to choose an orchestrator.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Comparing Kestra to CI/CD Tools
As we've already clarified the difference between orchestration and automation, let’s dive into how Kestra stacks up against popular CI/CD tools. 

### Kestra Vs. GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the go-to for many developers because it’s embedded right into GitHub, making it super convenient for CI/CD as it allows to build, test, and deploy code right from GitHub: basically, anything developers needs to do in their day-to-day work.

GitHub Actions is also developer-friendly, easy to set up, and integrates well with your codebase. But where it excels in simplicity, it lacks in handling workflows that need to span across multiple systems, such as deploying applications on various platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP): this is where Kestra shines

In fact, if your workflow goes beyond just automating builds and deployments  —let’s say you need to automate data processing tasks across cloud services — Kestra’s orchestration capabilities really shine. Kestra, in fact, can handle more complex workflows with dependencies between services, and it also provides mechanisms for error handling and managing events - even [in real time](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.md).

So, if your use case involves coordinating tasks beyond GitHub, Kestra becomes a better choice than GitHub actions.

### Kestra Vs. GitLab CI/CD
Like GitHub Actions, [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/index.html) is a great tool for CI/CD. It's integrated directly with GitLab and works well for automating pipelines from code commits to production. GitLab CI also scales nicely, especially if you’re already in the GitLab ecosystem.

Although GitLab CI/CD is more suited for teams needing advanced pipeline capabilities and integrated DevOps tooling than GitHub Actions, it basically has the same weakness of GitHub Actions when the game becomes harder.

In fact, when you need something that can handle orchestration across multiple environments, or when workflows involve more than just code deployments, Kestra’s orchestration tools take over. For example: do you need to coordinate a workflow that involves running processes across different cloud providers or managing task dependencies in a data pipeline? That’s where Kestra outperforms GitLab CI/CD which is great for automating code deployments, but Kestra is designed to manage more intricate workflows that span different systems and cloud environments.


### Kestra Vs. Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is another heavy hitter for CI/CD, particularly if you’re in the Microsoft ecosystem. It’s a fully integrated toolchain that works well for automating pipelines, managing repos, and monitoring applications.

But again, its core strength lies in CI/CD, not in orchestrating workflows across multiple systems or environments.

For example, let’s say you’re managing a workflow that includes tasks across multiple cloud providers, and Azure is just one part of the puzzle. Maybe you’re also pulling in data from AWS or triggering workflows based on events in GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Kestra allows you to orchestrate these tasks in a single workflow, regardless of which system is involved. 

So, while Azure DevOps is great for Microsoft-centric pipelines, Kestra offers the flexibility to handle distributed, cross-cloud workflows with ease.


### Kestra vs. Jenkins
Ah, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) — the old reliable. It has been around forever, and it has a [massive ecosystem of plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to automate almost anything. You can pretty much build anything with Jenkins, but here’s the rub: you’ll need to do a lot of that building yourself as it requires a lot of configuration, and if you’re managing complex workflows, you’ll likely end up with custom scripts and a mess of plugins.

So, Jenkins can automate simple tasks like nobody’s business, but Kestra is all about scaling those workflows across systems with less hassle. With Kestra, you’re not diving into custom scripting to handle error states or retries—it’s built-in. If your workload involves tasks that span cloud services, need precise error handling, or have complex dependencies, Kestra handles all that for you out of the box without the plugin bloat or script maintenance headaches.


## Key Features that Make Kestra Stand Out
By now, you’re surely seeing the pattern: the mentioned tools are great for CI/CD and managing simple workflows while Kestra is purpose-built for orchestrating complex workflows across different systems. 

So, let’s zero in on a few of Kestra’s key features that make it stand out.

**Task Orchestration**
Kestra’s primary strength is in orchestrating tasks across multiple environments. It doesn’t matter if those tasks are happening on different cloud providers, on-prem servers, or in a hybrid environment—Kestra manages the flow of tasks smoothly. CI/CD tools can kick off a build or deploy code, but Kestra can handle workflows that include those steps plus data processing tasks, external API calls, or anything else your workflow requires.

**Error Handling and Retries**
In traditional automation tools, error handling and retries often require custom scripting. Kestra, instead, bakes this into its core. In fact, if a task fails, Kestra can automatically retry it, adjust workflows dynamically, or trigger error-specific branches in the workflow. This is a huge time-saver when working with workflows prone to errors, like distributed systems or long-running data processing jobs.

**Cloud-Native and Distributed Systems Support**
Kestra was built with modern cloud-native and distributed systems in mind. Whether you’re orchestrating workflows across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem services, Kestra can handle it all. It’s designed to manage tasks that live in various environments without extra configuration or complexity.

**Event-Driven Architecture**
A lot of modern workflows are event-driven, and Kestra really shines here. You can trigger workflows based on events happening across your stack, whether that’s a file being uploaded, a database change, or an API call. This makes Kestra super flexible for managing real-time and batch workflows alike.

**Visual Workflow Editor**
While automation tools often require you to dive into YAML or script configurations, Kestra offers a visual workflow editor. You can build and manage your workflows in a more intuitive, visual way, reducing the cognitive load of managing complex systems.
