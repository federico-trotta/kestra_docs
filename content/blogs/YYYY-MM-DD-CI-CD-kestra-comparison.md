In a recent [blog](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we've defined what an orchestrator is, what are the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when should you choose an orchestrator over a CI/CD solution?

In this article, we'll compare Kestra to popular CI/CD solutions to help you get a practical understanding of when to choose an orchestrator over a CI/CD tool. In particular, at the end of the article, we'll provide a deep comparison between Kestra and Jenkins.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Comparing Kestra to CI/CD Tools
As we've already clarified the difference between orchestration and automation in the above-mentioned blog, let’s directly dive into how Kestra stacks up against popular CI/CD tools. 

### Kestra Vs. GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the go-to for many developers because it’s embedded right into GitHub, making it super convenient for CI/CD as it allows to build, test, and deploy code right from GitHub: basically, anything developers needs to do in their day-to-day work.

GitHub Actions is also developer-friendly, easy to set up, and integrates well with your codebase.

But where it excels in simplicity, it lacks in handling workflows that need to span across multiple systems, such as deploying applications on various platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP): this is where Kestra shines

In fact, if your workflow goes beyond just automating builds and deployments  — let’s say you need to automate data processing tasks across cloud services — here's where Kestra’s orchestration capabilities really shine. Kestra, in fact, can handle more complex workflows with dependencies between services, and it also provides mechanisms for error handling and managing events - even [in real time](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.md).

So, if your use case involves coordinating tasks beyond GitHub, Kestra becomes a better choice than GitHub actions.

### Kestra Vs. GitLab CI/CD
Like GitHub Actions, [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/index.html) is a great tool for CI/CD. It's integrated directly with GitLab and works well for automating pipelines from code commits to production. GitLab CI also scales nicely, especially if you’re already in the GitLab ecosystem.

![GitLab CI/CD by Federico Trotta](/blogs/YYYY-MM-DD-CI-CD-kestra-comparison/gitlab_cicd.png)

Although GitLab CI/CD is more suited for teams needing advanced pipeline capabilities and integrated DevOps tooling than GitHub Actions, it basically has the same weakness as GitHub Actions when the game becomes harder.

In fact, when you need something that can handle orchestration across multiple environments, or when workflows involve more than just code deployments, Kestra’s orchestration tools take over.

For example: do you need to coordinate a workflow that involves running processes across different cloud providers or managing task dependencies in a data pipeline? That’s where Kestra outperforms GitLab CI/CD which is great for automating code deployments, but Kestra is designed to manage more intricate workflows that span different systems and cloud environments.


### Kestra Vs. Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is another heavy hitter for CI/CD, particularly if you’re in the Microsoft ecosystem. It’s a fully integrated toolchain that works well for automating pipelines, managing repos, and monitoring applications. 

![Azure DevOps workflow by Federico Trotta](/blogs/YYYY-MM-DD-CI-CD-kestra-comparison/azure_devops.png)

But again, its core strength lies in CI/CD, not in orchestrating workflows across multiple systems or environments.

For example, let’s say you’re managing a workflow that includes tasks across multiple cloud providers, and Azure is just one part of the puzzle. Maybe you’re also pulling in data from AWS or triggering workflows based on events in GCP (Google Cloud Platform). Kestra allows you to orchestrate these tasks in a single workflow, regardless of which system is involved. 

So, while Azure DevOps is great for Microsoft-centric pipelines, Kestra offers the flexibility to handle distributed, cross-cloud workflows with ease.


### Kestra vs. Jenkins
Ah, [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) — the old reliable. It has been around forever, and it has a [massive ecosystem of plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to automate almost anything. You can pretty much build anything with Jenkins, but here’s the rub: you’ll need to do a lot of that building yourself as it requires a lot of configuration, and if you’re managing complex workflows, you’ll likely end up with custom scripts and a mess of plugins.

![A use of Jenkins by Federico Trotta](/blogs/YYYY-MM-DD-CI-CD-kestra-comparison/jenkins.png)

So, Jenkins can automate simple tasks like nobody’s business, but Kestra is all about scaling those workflows across systems with less hassle. With Kestra, you’re not diving into custom scripting to handle error states or retries—it’s built-in.

So, if your workload involves tasks that span cloud services, need precise error handling, or have complex dependencies, Kestra handles all that for you out of the box without the plugin bloat or script maintenance headaches.


## Key Features that Make Kestra Stand Out
By now, you’re surely seeing the pattern: the tools we mentioned are great for CI/CD and managing simple workflows, while Kestra is purpose-built for orchestrating complex workflows across different systems. Basically, if you're working on the GitHub environment and need a CI solution, you'll use GitHub Actions. The same thing applies if you're in the GitLab ecosystem.

But what if you need to manage workflows that span multiple environments?. Here's where Kestra comes into the game!

So, let’s zero in on a few of Kestra’s key features that make it stand out:

- **Tasks Orchestration**: Kestra’s primary strength is in orchestrating tasks across multiple environments. It doesn’t matter if those tasks are happening on different cloud providers, on-prem servers, or in a hybrid environment: Kestra manages the flow of tasks smoothly. For example: CI/CD tools can kick off a build or deploy code, but Kestra can handle workflows that include those steps plus data processing tasks, external API calls, or anything else your workflow requires.

- **Error Handling and Retries**: In traditional automation tools, error handling and retries often require custom scripting. Kestra, instead, bakes this into its core. In fact, if a task fails, Kestra can automatically retry it, adjust workflows dynamically, or trigger error-specific branches in the workflow. This is a huge time-saver when working with workflows prone to errors, like distributed systems or long-running data processing jobs.

- **Cloud-Native and Distributed Systems Support**: Kestra was built with modern [cloud-native](./2022-06-21-light-architecture.md) and distributed systems in mind. Whether you’re orchestrating workflows across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem services, Kestra can handle it all. It’s designed to manage tasks that live in various environments without extra configuration or complexity.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A lot of modern workflows are event-driven, and Kestra really shines here. You can trigger workflows based on events happening across your stack, whether that’s a file being uploaded, a database change, or an API call. This makes Kestra super flexible for managing real-time and batch workflows alike.

## When to Use Kestra Over CI/CD Tools
So, there’s no doubt that CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and Azure DevOps are powerful — especially when your needs are strictly related to CI/CD. But, as we've seen so far, Kestra comes into its own when you need to orchestrate more than just code deployments.

So, here are some typical cases where you'd need to use Kestra rather than any CI/CD tool:

- **Complex workflows**: When you have a workflow that has dependencies or requires coordination across different services, Kestra’s orchestration capabilities make it the better choice.

- **Distributed systems**: For workflows that span multiple cloud environments or microservices, Kestra simplifies coordination and ensures tasks are completed in the right order, with built-in error handling.

- **Error-prone workflows**: For workflows where errors and retries are expected, Kestra’s built-in error handling and retry mechanisms save you from writing custom scripts to manage failures.

## Kestra Vs. Jenkins: A Deep Comparison
So, along this article, we've described how Kestra differes from CI/CD tools and when you should choose it over them.

Now it's time to get a practical understanding example. To do so, we'll compare Kestra to Jenkins, and we'll:
- Describe why developers use Jenkins.
- Difficulties that developers encounter in using Jenkins and how Kestra can solve them.

Let's start!

### Why Developers Use Jenkins
Jenkins has many pros, and we believe the three that are woth mentioning are:

1. **Wide Adoption and Ecosystem**: Jenkins has been around for over a decade, so it is mature and "battle-tested": this makes it a staple in continuous integration and deployment. Also, its vast plugin ecosystem and open-source nature make it adaptable for almost any CI/CD pipeline need.

2. **Flexibility**: With Jenkins, developers can create highly customized pipelines as it supports different environments, tools, and languages.

3. **Community Support**: Jenkinse has an active community that ensures there’s a large amount of documentation, tutorials, and forums where developers can find answers to their problems.

### Difficulties Developers Encounter Using Jenkins
While Jenkins is a powerful tool, it does come with some challenges.

Let's see them together.

#### Plugin Overload
Jenkins has over 1,900 plugins, and this creates complexity as they can conflict with each other. Also, updating them can break pipelines, causing downtime.

Kestra, on the other hand, offers built-in integrations for many common use cases without the need for plugins, and this reduces the risk of compatibility issues. For exampple, in Kestra A CI/CD pipeline can be defined in a YAML configuration, and all the components work seamlessly together.

#### Groovy Syntax
Jenkins uses [Groovy-based](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/groovy/) scripting for pipeline creation, which can be unintuitive for developers unfamiliar with it - as it also a language now widely used. This can create a steep learning curve that can slow down development and cause errors.

Kestra, instead, uses a declarative YAML-based syntax that is much easier to read and write. So, instead of writing custom Groovy scripts, developers can define conditions, steps, and exceptions directly in YAML: this lowers the learning curve and reduces the chance of errors. For example, here's how you can implement a [condition](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/conditions/io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.expressioncondition) that will return false for a missing variable:

```yaml
- conditions:
    - type: io.kestra.plugin.core.condition.ExpressionCondition
      expression: {{ unknown is defined }}
```

#### Debugging and Troubleshooting
In Jenkins, debugging pipelines can be difficult as logs can become scattered across different plugins and stages, making it hard to trace the root cause of an issue.

Kestra, instead, provides centralized logging and error-handling across all tasks in a workflow. If a pipeline fails, developers can easily view the entire execution history and debug issues with a unified logging system. 

#### Scalability Challenges
Jenkins requires a lot of manual setup for distributed builds or scaling across [multiple nodes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/nodes/), and this can lead to bottlenecks when the infrastructure needs to grow.

Instead, as Kestra is designed for distributed, cloud-native workflows it automatically handles scaling and parallelism without the need to manually configure nodes. Developers can define [parallel tasks](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.parallel) directly in their workflows, and Kestra manages the execution across distributed resources in the YAML just like so:

```yaml
id: parallel
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: parallel
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel
    tasks:
      - id: 1st
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"
      - id: 2nd
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.id }}"
  - id: last
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"

```
