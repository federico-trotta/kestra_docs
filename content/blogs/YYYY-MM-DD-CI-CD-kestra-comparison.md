In a recent [blog](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we've defined what an orchestrator is, what are the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when to choose an orchestrator?

In this article, we'll compare Kestra to popular automation tools to help you get a practical understanding of when to choose an orchestrator.

Ready? Let's dive in!

## Comparing Kestra to Automation Tools
As we've already clarified the difference between orchestration and automation, let’s dive into how Kestra stacks up against popular automation tools. 

### Kestra Vs. GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the go-to for many developers because it’s embedded right into GitHub, making it super convenient for CI/CD as it allows to build, test, and deploy code right from GitHub: basically, anything developers needs to do in their day-to-day work.

Also, GitHub actions it’s developer-friendly, easy to set up, and integrates well with your codebase. But where it excels in simplicity, it lacks in handling workflows that need to span across multiple systems and here's where Kestra comes into handy.

In fact, if your workflow goes beyond just automating builds and deployments  —let’s say you need to automate data processing tasks across cloud services — Kestra’s orchestration capabilities really shine. Kestra, in fact, can handle more complex workflows with dependencies between services, and it also provides mechanisms for error handling and managing events - even [in real time](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.md).

So, if your use case involves coordinating tasks beyond GitHub, Kestra becomes a better choice than GitHub actions.

### Kestra vs. GitLab CI/CD
Like GitHub Actions, [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/index.html) is a great tool for CI/CD. It's integrated directly with GitLab and works well for automating pipelines from code commits to production. GitLab CI also scales nicely, especially if you’re already in the GitLab ecosystem.

Although GitLab CI/CD is more suited for teams needing advanced pipeline capabilities and integrated DevOps tooling than GitHub Actions, it basically has the same weakness of GitHub Actions when the game becomes harder.

In fact, when you need something that can handle orchestration across multiple environments, or when workflows involve more than just code deployments, Kestra’s orchestration tools take over. For example: do you need to coordinate a workflow that involves running processes across different cloud providers or managing task dependencies in a data pipeline? That’s where Kestra outperforms GitLab CI/CD whic is great for automating code deployments, but Kestra is designed to manage more intricate workflows that span different systems and cloud environments.
