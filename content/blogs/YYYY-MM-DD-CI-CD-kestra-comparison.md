In a recent [blog](./2024-09-18-what-is-an-orchestrator.md), we defined what an orchestrator is, what the differences between orchestration and automation, and how orchestration can help you to automate your workflows.

Now, it's time to answer the question: when should you choose an orchestrator over a CI/CD solution?

In this article, we'll explore what CI/CD tools are, dive into some of the most popular ones, and see how Kestra brings something unique to the table. In particular, we'll also provide a deep comparison between Kestra and Jenkins.

## What Are CI/CD Tools?
Before comparing CI/CD tools, let's describe what they are.

CI/CD tools are software applications that automate the processes of integrating code changes (Continuous Integration) and deploying applications (Continuous Deployment) to production environments. They help teams collaborate effectively by automating builds, tests, and deployments, ensuring that new features and bug fixes are delivered quickly and reliably.

In particular, they:

- **Automate builds**: Compile source code into executable programs.
- **Run tests**: Execute automated tests to verify code changes.
- **Deploy applications**: Automatically release new code to production or staging environments.
- **Provide feedback**: Alert developers about build statuses and test results.
T
So, these tools are fundamental for maintaining high-quality code and rapid release cycles in today's fast-paced development environments.

## Most Used CI/CD Tools
There are a lot of CI/CD tools out there, so let's take a closer look at some of the most popular ones. For each, we'll provide an overview, highlight a unique feature, and list pros and cons.

### GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is GitHub's integrated CI/CD solution, allowing you to automate your workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It enables you to build, test, and deploy your code right alongside your pull requests and issues.

## Why Kestra Stands Out
After exploring these popular CI/CD tools, you might be wondering where Kestra fits in. So, let's dive into what makes Kestra unique and when it might be the right choice for your projects.

### Kestra: orchestrating complex workflows with ease
Kestra is an open-source orchestration and scheduling platform designed to handle complex workflows across various systems. While traditional CI/CD tools focus on automating code integration and deployment, Kestra specializes in orchestrating tasks that span multiple environments and services.

Here are its unique capabilities:

- **Unified orchestration across systems**: Kestra allows you to manage workflows involving different cloud providers, databases, APIs, and more—all from a single platform.
- **Real-time event triggers**: Supports [event-driven](./2024-06-27-realtime-triggers.m) architectures, enabling workflows to react to events like file uploads, database changes, or API calls.
- **Visual workflow editor**: Provides an intuitive interface to design and visualize workflows, reducing complexity and making it accessible even for those new to orchestration.
- **Robust error handling and retries**: Built-in mechanisms for managing failures and retries without the need for custom scripting, ensuring reliability.
- **Scalable and distributed execution**: Designed for cloud-native environments, Kestra handles parallelism and scaling seamlessly, making it ideal for large-scale data processing.

### When to choose Kestra over traditional CI/CD tools
At this point, you might be wondering when to choose Kestra over a CI/CI tool. So here are some guidelines to consider:

- **Complex, multi-system workflows**: If your workflows involve coordinating tasks across various platforms and services, Kestra simplifies this orchestration.
- **Event-driven processes**: For applications that need to respond to real-time events, Kestra's event triggers are invaluable.
- **Enhanced error handling**: When reliability is critical, Kestra's robust error management ensures workflows can recover gracefully.
- **Visual design preference**: If you prefer designing workflows visually rather than scripting them, Kestra's editor is a significant advantage.
- **Scalability needs**: For projects that require handling large-scale data processing or distributed tasks, Kestra is built to scale efficiently.

## Kestra Vs. Jenkins: A Deep Comparison
So, along this article, we've described how Kestra differes from CI/CD tools and when you should choose it over them.

Now it's time to get a practical example. To do so, we'll compare Kestra to Jenkins, and we'll:
- Describe why developers use Jenkins.
- Difficulties that developers encounter in using Jenkins and how Kestra can solve them.

Let's start!

### Why Developers Use Jenkins
Jenkins has many pros, and we believe the three that are woth mentioning are:

1. **Wide Adoption and Ecosystem**: Jenkins has been around for over a decade, so it is mature and "battle-tested": this makes it a staple in continuous integration and deployment. Also, its vast plugin ecosystem and open-source nature make it adaptable for almost any CI/CD pipeline need.

2. **Flexibility**: With Jenkins, developers can create highly customized pipelines as it supports different environments, tools, and languages.

3. **Community Support**: Jenkins has an active community that ensures there’s a large amount of documentation, tutorials, and forums where developers can find answers to their problems.

Now, let's see where Jenkins falls short.

### Difficulties Developers Encounter Using Jenkins
While Jenkins is a powerful tool, it does come with some challenges.

Let's see them together.

#### Plugin Overload
Jenkins currently has over 1,900 plugins, and this creates complexity as they can conflict with each other. Also, updating them can break pipelines, causing downtime.

Kestra, on the other hand, offers built-in integrations for many common use cases without the need for plugins, and this reduces the risk of compatibility issues. For exampple, in Kestra a CI/CD pipeline can be defined in a YAML configuration, and all the components work seamlessly together.

#### Groovy Syntax
Jenkins uses [Groovy-based](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/groovy/) scripting for pipeline creation, which can be unintuitive for developers unfamiliar with it - as it also a language not widely used. This can create a steep learning curve that can slow down development and cause errors.

Kestra, instead, uses a declarative YAML-based syntax that is much easier to read and write. 

#### Debugging and Troubleshooting
In Jenkins, debugging pipelines can be difficult as logs can become scattered across different plugins and stages, making it hard to trace the root cause of an issue.

Kestra, instead, provides centralized logging and error-handling across all tasks in a workflow. If a pipeline fails, developers can easily view the entire execution history and debug issues with a unified logging system.

#### Scalability Challenges
Jenkins requires a lot of manual setup for distributed builds or scaling across [multiple nodes](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/nodes/), and this can lead to bottlenecks when the infrastructure needs to grow.

Instead, as Kestra is designed for distributed, cloud-native workflows it automatically handles scaling and parallelism without the need to manually configure nodes. Developers can define [parallel tasks](https://kestra.io/plugins/core/tasks/flows/io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.parallel) directly in their workflows, and Kestra manages the execution across distributed resources in the YAML just like so:

```yaml
id: parallel
namespace: company.team

tasks:
  - id: parallel
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.flow.Parallel
    tasks:
      - id: 1st
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"
      - id: 2nd
        type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
        format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.id }}"
  - id: last
    type: io.kestra.plugin.core.debug.Return
    format: "{{ task.id }} > {{ taskrun.startDate }}"

```


## Conclusions
In conclusion, choosing between Kestra and CI/CD tools depends on your specific requirements.

If you're looking for a comprehensive CI/CD solution that can satisfy basic needs, then tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, or Jenkins might suit your needs perfectly, also depending on the ecosystem you're working on. Instead, if you need to manage workflows that involve multiple systems, Kestra is the clear winner as its main abilities regard handling complex workflows, integrating with diverse systems, and offerering robust error handling making it an easy choice even for beginners.
